This is the implementation for assignment project_02 in the course ENGI 301 at Rice University.

Included are the schematics, layout, and library in Autodesk EAGLE, along with basic manufacturing (gerber) files, a BOM, screenshots and PDFs that additionall document the design.

The board exists with the express purpose to implement the circuit in project_01 that joined all the PocketBeagle, PMS5003, CCS811, AHT10, and ILI9341 LCD together to form a more
elegant air quality module. Further work may entail design of a relatively rudimentary 3D printed case that utilizes the mounting holes on the PCB design, and this would likely still
run off USB power for packaging concerns.
